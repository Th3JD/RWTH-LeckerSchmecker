\n\

\n\

rating_tutorial=*The rating system:*\n\
Next to the meals, you will also see 2 ratings: The global rating and your personal rating\\. The global rating is the mean rating of all user ratings for the respective dish\\. Next to this rating, you will also see, how many ratings this mean is based on\\. Your persoal rating is your last rating for this meal\\. The ‚ùì\\-Symbol indicates, that you did not rate this exact meal yet\\. In this case, the given rating is an estimation based on your ratings for similar meals\\.\n\
\n\
*How to vote:*\n\
After eating, you can select the "Rate"\\-option in the main menu\\. If you have not set a default canteen yet, the bot will then ask you to select a canteen\\. Then, you can select the meal, and rate this meal on a scale from 1 to 10 \\(please rate the main meal, not the side dishes\\)\\. Please remember that you are rating meals from a canteen, so please use the scale accordingly \\(a "10" is not the best meal you ever had, but rather the best meal you had at the canteen\\)\\. Note that you can only rate meals, that were offered at your selected \\(or default\\) canteen on that day\\. The rating is also constrained to meals of the current day\\. Therefore, please vote immediately after having your meal\\!\n\
\n\
You can also only vote for up to two meals per day\\. Voting for more meals on the same day, will delete your previous rating\\.
settings_tutorial=The Settings\\-menu can be accessed from the main menu\\.\n\
