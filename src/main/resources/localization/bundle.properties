\n\
*Meals:*\n\
To get the meals at your preferred canteen, you first select the "Meals"\\-button\\. Then, you can select your preferred canteen \\(assuming you have not yet set your preferred canteen in the defaults\\) and the date you want to get the meal list for\\. Note that the bot only offers the meal lists 3 days in advance\\.\n\
\n\
After you get the list of meals, you will see symbols next to the meals:\n\
\n\
\uD83C\uDF31 indicates vegan meals\\.\n\
\uD83E\uDDC0 indicates vegetarian meals\\.\n\
\uD83D\uDC37 indicates meals that contain pork\\.\n\
\uD83D\uDC14 indicates meals that contain poultry\\.\n\
\uD83D\uDC2E indicates meals that contain beef\\.\n\
\uD83D\uDC1F indicates meals that contain fish\\.\n\
\uD83C\uDF36 indicates spicy meals\\.\n\
\uD83C\uDF6E indicates sweet meals\\.\n\
\n\
*The rating system:*\n\
Next to the meals, you will also see 2 ratings: The global rating and your personal rating\\. The global rating is the mean rating of all user ratings for the respective dish\\. Next to this rating, you will also see, how many ratings this mean is based on\\. Your persoal rating is the mean of all ratings, you made for this meal\\.\n\
\n\
*How to vote:*\n\
After eating, you can select the "Rate"\\-option in the main menu\\. If you have not set a default canteen yet, the bot will then ask you to select a canteen\\. Then, you can select the meal, and rate this meal on a scale from 1 to 10 \\(please rate the main meal, not the side dishes\\)\\. Please remember that you are rating meals from a canteen, so please use the scale accordingly \\(a "10" is not the best meal you ever had, but rather the best meal you had at the canteen\\)\\. Note that you can only rate meals, that were offered at your selected \\(or default\\) canteen on that day\\. The rating is also constrained to the opening hours of the respective canteen\\. Therefore, please vote immediately after having your meal\\!\n\
\n\
You can also only vote for one meal per day\\. Voting for another meal on the same day, will delete your previous rating\\.\n\
\n\
*Default values:*\n\
In the "Defaults"\\-menu \\(available in the main menu\\), you can set or reset your defaults\\.\n\
\n\
The available defaults are:\n\
\\- __Canteen__: Here you can select your preferred canteen\\. After selecting a preferred canteen, you will not be asked for a canteen when asking for the list of meals, or when rating a meal\\.\n\
\n\
\\- __Language__: Currently, there are bot\\-languages available: English, German and Spanish\\. The default language is English\\.\n\
\n\
\\- __Diet__: Here you can select, if you are vegan, vegetarian, do not eat fish, do not eat pork, or eat everything\\. After selecting your diet, the bot will only display meals, that are compatible with your diet\\. The default value of this option is: "I eat everything\\!"\\.
